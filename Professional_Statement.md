## Professional Statement

### ***"In cybersecurity, strategy isn't just reactive; it's proactive. You defend best by thinking ahead of your adversaries."***


I am a cybersecurity and IT professional committed to continuous learning, disciplined execution, and proactive defense. My career has centered around building secure, reliable systems while staying ahead of evolving threats through research, hands-on practice, and real-world problem-solving. With experience in network engineering, vulnerability management, security operations, cloud governance, and incident response, I bring a technical foundation strengthened by strong communication, analytical thinking, and a calm, structured approach to high-pressure situations.

My core values — integrity, accountability, authenticity, and hard work — shape every aspect of my professional life. Whether securing infrastructure, troubleshooting complex issues, or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I approach every challenge with focus, adaptability, and a commitment to doing the right thing even when no one is watching.

I hold certifications including GIAC GFACT, CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Network+, ISC2 CC, Google Cybersecurity, multiple Qualys certifications, and extensive FEMA/NIMS credentials related to incident command, critical infrastructure protection, and continuity operations. I continue to expand my knowledge in areas such as cloud security, endpoint protection, system hardening, and security architecture to stay ahead of emerging risks.

What drives me is the meaningful impact cybersecurity has on people, organizations, and critical infrastructure. My long-term goal is to support public-sector cybersecurity efforts, protect mission-critical systems, and contribute to the resilience and security of the communities we serve.

With a blend of technical skill, professional discipline, and a genuine passion for the field, I am dedicated to strengthening security posture, elevating operational readiness, and contributing to a safer, more resilient digital environment.
