## 🤔 Who Am I?

Hello there! I’m Justin Goncalves, a cybersecurity enthusiast and classical pianist with a passion for both the digital world and the arts. When I'm not diving deep into cybersecurity challenges, I’m at the piano, exploring the complexities of my favorite composer, Frederic Chopin. His Ballade No. 4, Op. 52, remains my all-time favorite piece, and I enjoy unraveling the intricacies of classical music theory through his works.

In my free time, I love staying active and embracing the outdoors. Whether hiking along scenic trails, swimming in Boston’s brisk waters, or jogging to clear my mind, staying active is essential for me. When I'm not working out, playing the piano, or immersed in cybersecurity, I enjoy unwinding with friends—especially after long hours in front of a screen. I’m passionate about playing and watching sports, particularly football and soccer. I’m also an avid fan of iconic movie sagas like *Star Wars*, the *Jason Bourne* series, Daniel Craig’s *James Bond*, and *The Matrix* trilogy.

My motivation comes from my parents, who immigrated to the U.S. and made countless sacrifices to provide me with a better life. Their resilience inspires me to pursue my goals relentlessly, especially in the ever-evolving world of technology. I’m constantly seeking new knowledge and skills to stay ahead in the rapidly changing landscape of cybersecurity.

With a foundation in IT management, web development, business operations, and healthcare, I’ve developed a deep understanding of how technology drives business. These experiences laid the groundwork for my transition into cybersecurity, where I now focus on vulnerability management, incident response, and ethical hacking.
