## 🤔 Who Am I?

Hi, I’m Justin Goncalves—a cybersecurity and IT professional with a deep appreciation for both technology and the arts. When I’m not securing systems or building infrastructure, I’m usually studying or diving into one of my many hobbies. I try to keep balance in my life, so outside of work I enjoy staying active—hiking, working out, and watching or playing football and soccer.

I’m also an avid reader with a particular love for action and thriller novels. Authors like Vince Flynn, Robert Ludlum, Lee Child, and Ian Fleming shaped my appreciation for strategy-driven storytelling, while classics like Moby Dick and Frankenstein keep me grounded in timeless literature. Music has always been a major part of my life. I’ve been a classical pianist for years, and I constantly return to Chopin’s Ballade No. 4, Op. 52. The discipline, structure, and emotional depth of classical music mirror the mindset I bring to cybersecurity—analytical, creative, and detail-oriented. Another strong interest of mine is financial markets. In my free time, I trade Nasdaq futures and run a content channel where I teach people about price action, market structure, and disciplined trading. It’s a space that blends analysis, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking—skills that connect naturally with cybersecurity.

My motivation comes from my parents, who immigrated to the U.S. and made significant sacrifices to build a better future for our family. Their resilience drives my work ethic, my commitment to growth, and my dedication to the opportunities in front of me.

Professionally, I’ve built experience in network engineering, IT management, cloud security, and defensive cybersecurity. I’ve learned how technology supports people and organizations at every level, and today my work focuses on identity security, vulnerability management, system hardening, cloud governance, and incident response. These areas allow me to make a meaningful impact by protecting critical systems and the people who rely on them.

At my core, I’m driven by curiosity, discipline, and a desire to protect and empower others. Whether in cybersecurity, music, sports, or trading, I’m always learning, refining my craft, and working toward building a safer, stronger digital world.

## 💡 Core Skills & Competencies

Throughout my cybersecurity and IT career, I’ve built a strong foundation of technical and analytical skills that allow me to secure systems, investigate threats, and maintain reliable, resilient environments. My expertise spans identity security, vulnerability management, incident response, system hardening, and network security, with hands-on experience supporting both cloud and on-premises infrastructures. I bring a disciplined, methodical approach to troubleshooting and threat analysis, paired with strong communication and problem-solving abilities that help me work effectively across technical and non-technical teams. I’m proficient with a wide range of industry tools—including Microsoft 365 security suite (Entra ID, Intune, Purview), Qualys, Splunk, Wireshark, TCPDump, and Linux-based security tooling—which enables me to identify risks, implement safeguards, and support secure operations end-to-end. My blend of technical depth, critical thinking, and practical experience allows me to address modern security challenges with precision, adaptability, and a proactive mindset.
