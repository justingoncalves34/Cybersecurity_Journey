### 📖 Background
I started my career working in pharmacy and healthcare, where I developed a passion for helping others. However, I was drawn to the endless possibilities that technology offers. My curiosity pushed me toward web development, a field that offered the freedom to innovate and build solutions from scratch, all while learning new skills constantly.

As I honed my skills as a freelance web developer, my focus gradually shifted to cybersecurity. The growing threats of **fraud**, **hacking**, and **cybercrime** piqued my interest, and I became deeply committed to understanding how to **mitigate risks** and **protect digital environments**. With a passion for learning and my commitment to data protection, I am constantly driven to explore the rapidly changing world of cybersecurity.
