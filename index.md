## About Me
My name is Justin Goncalves, and I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a diverse background in business management, data analysis, IT support, and web development. My strong curiosity and passion for solving complex challenges have driven my interest in information security, particularly in penetration testing and ethical hacking. I am currently focused on expanding my expertise in vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response as I work toward becoming a Tier 1 Cybersecurity Analyst. For me, cybersecurity isn’t just a job—it’s a chance to protect the future, make a meaningful impact, and contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world.

### Background
I began my professional journey working in pharmacy and healthcare for several years, where I developed a deep appreciation for helping others. However, I was always drawn to the vast possibilities that technology offers. My curiosity led me into web development, as I found coding and programming fascinating. I loved the idea that in tech, there is an infinite amount of knowledge to learn and endless potential for what you can create.

After spending time as a freelance web developer, my interests shifted toward cybersecurity. I became increasingly aware of fraud, hacking, and the growing threat of cybercrime. This sparked my desire to understand how these risks could be prevented and mitigated. Watching videos and taking online courses on cybersecurity opened up a new world for me, and I became obsessed with learning as much as I could about the field. Now, I am fully dedicated to becoming a cybersecurity professional, combining my love of learning with a mission to secure the digital landscape.
